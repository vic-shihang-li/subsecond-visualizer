# subsecond-visualizer

Understanding different subsecond time units:

```
1,000  nanoseconds = 1 microsecond
1,000 microseconds = 1 millisecond
1,000 milliseconds = 1 second
```

Therefore,

```
1 second = 1,000         milliseconds (1k ms)
1 second = 1,000,000     microseconds (1 million Î¼s)
1 second = 1,000,000,000  nanoseconds (1 billion ns)
```
